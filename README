I was deepluy inspired by having to log in and two factor verify for every single thing that i do online.

I am so glad that i now have to do this like 4 or 5 times a day. Before when it was just once it was way too easy, and made me very nervous about the security of my canvas account. I feel so lucky that the university takes the security and safety of its student's powerpoint slides and assignments so seriously.

This is an improvement on the current implementation. Phone numbers can easily be spoofed, and sim swapping is a rising issue worldwide. Our phones cannot be accurately used to identify us as human. Therefore, this takes into account something that can't be faked: our knowlege and abilities as students.

This is a quick, easy and effective way to verify students before submission.

I copy and pasted nearly all of this... please please please dont sue me please dear company i copied from i promise i love your verification.
